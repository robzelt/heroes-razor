# Tour of Heroes

The Tour of Heroes project was originally created by [John Papa](http://twitter.com/john_papa) to help represent a fundamental app written with Angular. This is a recreation of the application written using ASP.NET Razor Components

The original apps written with Vue and React can be found at at [github.com/johnpapa/heroes-vue](https://github.com/johnpapa/heroes-vue) and [github.com/johnpapa/heroes-react](https://github.com/johnpapa/heroes-react)

## Why

As John previously stated 'One of the most common questions I hear is "which framework is best?". I like to flip this around and ask you "which is best for you?". The best way to know this is to try it for yourself.' I decided to follow his advice and use a non-JavaScript framework to create the same result.
